# CT_ARCH_ARCH controls the specific architecture that the toolchain's libraries
# are built with. It should specify the minimum RISC-V extensions that need to
# be implemented by any processor that this toolchain will compile programs for.
#
# 2020-03-26: We have added B extension (v0.92) support to the compiler using
#             experimental patches, but we still want to support Ibex without
#             the B extension, so this remains "rv32imc".

# CT_ARCH_ABI controls the specific ABI that the toolchain's libraries are built
# with. All programs built against this toolchain should follow exactly this
# ABI.
