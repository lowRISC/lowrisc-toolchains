# CT_ARCH_ARCH controls the specific architecture that the toolchain's libraries
# are built with. It should specify the minimum RISC-V extensions that need to
# be implemented by any processor that this toolchain will compile programs for.
#
# 2022-01-13: We can now generally assume that Ibex supports bitmanip, so we can
#             compile the toolchain libraries with bitmanip 1.0 support.
#
#               N.B. OpenTitan still requires support for Ibex without bitmanip
#               (in the English Breakfast toplevel design) but OpenTitan is
#               freestanding, so it shouldn't use these libraries.
#
#             Unfortunately, when we tried to enable the ratified bitmanip
#             subset here by specifying `CT_ARCH_ARCH=rv32imc_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs`
#             the toolchain failed to compile, saying that `rol` (from Zbb)
#             wasn't a recognized instruction. Until this is solved we don't
#             compile the libraries with bitmanip. This doesn't really matter
#             for our current use cases.
